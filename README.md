Transmogrify Website Code Repository

What's this?
------------

Transmogrify is a website that allow you to select your transmogrification for the massive multiplayer online roleplay game World of Warcraft.
The code is the Core of the website.

It uses:

* PHP5
* MySQL Database
* Shell scripts
* Java JRE6

Several additional files are required in the Server to make the project properly works. This is not a project that can be used "as it", but can serve to others.
The gathering process of World of Warcraft data could be useful.

A copy of the World of Warcraft Item database will be available soon in the repository.

Always in development

The project is always in development.
